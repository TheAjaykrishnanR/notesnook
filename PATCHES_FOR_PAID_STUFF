we have a case "upgrade" in notesnook/packages/core/src/api/index.js with the following code:

case "upgrade": {
            const user = await this.user.getUser();
            user.subscription = data;
            await this.user.setUser(user);
            EV.publish(EVENTS.userSubscriptionUpdated, data);
            break;
          }



here we have to take notice of a few things: user, getUser and setUser methods, and the publish methods of the EV object (is it possibly the subscription state )

theres a fucking function called as isUserPremium in notesnook/packages/core/src/common.js 



premium checking functions in :

PATCH: notesnook/apps/web/src/hooks/use-is-user-premium.ts -> isUserPremium()
PATCH: notesnook/packages/core/src/common.js -> checkIsUserPremium()
apps/web/src/common/constants.ts -> subscription status type defined in
PATCH: notesnook/packages/core/src/collections/attachment.js -> _getEncryptionKey -> attackment key generator
